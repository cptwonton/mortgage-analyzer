# ‚öñÔ∏è Rent vs Buy Calculator - Development Plan

## üöß Current Status: DISABLED

the eternal question. should you keep throwing money at rent or buy something? this was gonna help figure out the break-even math but it's not ready yet.

**Why Disabled:**
- Complex calculation logic needs more refinement
- User experience needs improvement  
- Better to launch when fully polished
- Prevents user confusion with incomplete features

## üéØ Original Vision

### What It Was Supposed To Do
- Take your current rent amount
- Show what house price would be equivalent
- Calculate break-even timeline
- Compare long-term costs
- Give simple recommendation: rent or buy

### Key Questions To Answer
- "I pay $2,500/month rent, should I buy instead?"
- "What house could I afford with my rent payment?"
- "When does buying become cheaper than renting?"
- "What if I invested my down payment instead?"

## üßÆ Calculation Challenges

### Calculation Mode Complexity
Two different ways to interpret rent input:
1. **Total Housing Mode**: Rent = total monthly housing budget
2. **Burnable Money Mode**: Rent = only money "burned" (excludes principal)

This affects the entire analysis since principal builds equity.

### Market Variables
- Property appreciation rates
- Investment return assumptions  
- Maintenance cost estimates
- Transaction cost calculations
- Tax benefit modeling

### Break-Even Analysis
- Opportunity cost of down payment
- Rent increases over time
- Home value appreciation
- Tax deductions for homeowners
- Transaction costs when selling

## üé® UI/UX Considerations

### Input Complexity
- Rent amount interpretation (total vs burnable)
- Down payment scenarios
- Local market assumptions
- Time horizon selection

### Results Display
- Clear recommendation (rent vs buy)
- Break-even timeline visualization
- Cost comparison charts
- Sensitivity analysis

### Educational Component
- Explain opportunity cost concept
- Clarify burnable money vs equity building
- Show assumptions behind calculations
- Help users understand trade-offs

## üîÆ When To Re-Enable

### Prerequisites
1. **Calculation Accuracy**: Verify all formulas and assumptions
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Test with unusual rent amounts and scenarios
3. **User Testing**: Ensure intuitive and educational experience
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Works well on all devices
5. **Performance**: Fast calculations and smooth interactions

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with simple rent-to-house-price equivalency
2. Add break-even timeline analysis
3. Include opportunity cost calculations
4. Add sensitivity analysis and scenarios
5. Polish UI and educational content

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Current State
- Basic calculation functions exist in `lib/rentVsBuyCalculations.ts`
- UI components built but disabled
- Landing page shows "under development"
- Coming soon page with feature preview

### When Re-Enabling
- Remove overlay from landing page card
- Replace coming soon page with actual calculator
- Add back Link wrapper and hover effects
- Test all calculation paths

## üéØ Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Users understand the recommendation
- Clear about assumptions and limitations
- Educational value beyond just numbers
- Helps with actual rent vs buy decisions

### Technical Quality
- Accurate calculations
- Fast performance
- Mobile responsive
- Error handling

## üí≠ Lessons Learned

### Complexity Underestimated
- Rent vs buy involves many variables
- Different users interpret "rent" differently
- Market assumptions significantly affect results
- Educational component is crucial

### Better To Disable Than Confuse
- Incomplete features frustrate users
- Professional "coming soon" maintains credibility
- Users appreciate transparency about development status
- Can take time to get calculations right

*Will return when truly ready for prime time*
