# 🏠 Mortgage Analyzer - Development Plan

## 🎯 Current Status: WORKING

The main mortgage calculator is fully functional and being used.

## 💡 Original Problem

was browsing zillow and kept trying to figure out payments in my head. got tired of it.

## ✅ What It Does Now

### Core Functionality
- Calculate monthly mortgage payments
- Show break-even rental income needed
- Distinguish between "burned" money and equity building
- Handle different loan types (conventional, ARM, etc.)
- Real-time calculations with input validation

### Break-Even Analysis
1. **Burnable Money**: Covers interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance
2. **Full Break-Even**: Covers everything including principal
3. **Investment Viable**: Adds buffer for vacancy and management

### User Experience
- Clean, responsive interface
- Real-time validation and feedback
- localStorage saves inputs
- Educational explanations
- Mobile-friendly design

## 🧮 Key Calculations

### Monthly Payment Components
- Principal and Interest (P&I)
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- PMI (if down payment < 20%)
- Maintenance reserves

### Break-Even Logic
```
Burnable Money = Interest + Taxes + Insurance + Maintenance + PMI
Full Break-Even = Burnable Money + Principal
Investment Viable = Full Break-Even + (Vacancy + Management buffers)
```

### ARM Handling
- Shows payment ranges (min/max)
- Accounts for rate adjustment periods
- Explains payment variability

## 🎨 Design Approach

### Authentic Voice
- Casual, conversational copy
- Explains concepts in plain language
- No corporate jargon
- Educational but approachable

### Visual Design
- Dark theme with glass-morphism
- Color-coded sections
- Smooth animations
- Clear visual hierarchy

### User Flow
1. Enter basic house info
2. Configure mortgage details
3. Set property expenses
4. View break-even analysis
5. Understand results with explanations
